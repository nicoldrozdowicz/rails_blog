# README
This is a RESTful API for a blog with both posts and comments.

A majority of this is Rails App boilerplate. If you want to take a look at the meaty stuff, I suggest checking out:
- app/models/post
- app/models/comment
- app/controllers/posts_controller
- app/controllers/comments_controller
- spec/controllers/posts_controller_spec
- spec/controllers/comments_controller_spec
- db/schema
- config/routes
